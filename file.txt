This a message to my fellow programmers
You gat to do what you have to do
This is a very short life
Do that project that keeps you up at night
Telling you, you can't wait to do it
And once that is done you will be very happy with yourself
You can even make money out of it
Do that thing that got you saying I want to study Computer Science
By the way this is Ceaser Speaking give what belongs to me to me.
